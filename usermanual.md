Analysis
--------

For Analysis we have the dashboard pages for:

-   Student profile

![](StudentProfile.png)

The Student profile page gives us a drill-down and history of all interventions
attempted with a student as well as summary information about absences and
grades. It allows us to filter by the intervention type and responsible party.

-   Attendance

![](Attendance.png)

The attendance dashboard page shows a summary of attendance by class, by day, by
date range or a summary by month. The left hand-side of the page works as a
filter by course and by absence type, Excused, unexcused, etc. The right hand
side shows a calendar view which allows quick visual inspection.

 

-   Assessment

The assessment page allows a quick overview and filtering of the different
assessments administered to a student

![](StudentAssessment1.png)

It allows filtering by the type of assessment, by the result type and by school
year, and shows the assessment results, the comparative results and the results
over time, for certain types of tests once the Result Type filter is applied.

![](StudentAssessment2.png)

-   Class grades

The course assessment interface  allows for filtering assessments by date, by
term, by period, by teacher,

course grades with the different filters allow for a more detailed drill down.

![](classassessment.png)

The chart shows a progression of grades over time with a simple regression
model.

-   Assessment-All students

This allows for the comparison of a student against all other students that took
that assessment.

![](allstudents.png)

This page can be filtered by student, by assessment, by result type, by grade
and schoolyear.

When filtering the assessment and result type, we can search for a specific
student and his Max Score will be shown in the top right corner of the
dashboard, then we can compare where he is compared with the rest of the
selection in the histogram.
